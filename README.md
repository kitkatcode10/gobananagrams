# H1 Banana Scramble

Welcome to Go Bananas! I'm so excited you've discovered a Bananagrams variant, and no it's not a variant like a bad banana. It's just a play on words (I hope). Bananagrams and word games like Scrabble are my favourite type of board game, so now we can blend them together and play banana scramble. BTW, all puns and play on words are in fact, intended.  

Please note, this is my first go at developing a word game, we're starting off small with pre-defined parameters, you can learn more about how we can take the game to the next level in the next steps section. 

##### H5 Game Instructions and Play: 
In 3 different rounds, you will be provided a handful of tiles that make up ONE single scrambled word (bananagram). To win the round, you have to unscramble the word using all the letters available by typing it into the banana basket. Just a few tips... the words are in the Merrian Webster Dictionary and are obviously banana themed! 

We'll keep track of your "Banan-attempts" and the words you've already made.
